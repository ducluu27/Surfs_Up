# Surfs_Up
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide tempearture data for the months of June and December in Oahu. With this information, W. Avy would be able to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results
- One difference between June and December temperature is that the December had the loest recorded temperature. The lowest record temperature in June was 64, while the lowest record temperature in Decemeber was 56.

- Another difference between June and December weather is that June had the highest max temperature. The max temperature for June was 85, and the max temperature for December was 83.

- The standard deviation for December is higher than July. The standard deviation for December was 3.75, while the standard deviation for June was 3.26.

### Summary
Based off these results I believe that a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round. The average temperature when comparing June and December are almost identical. Also, most of the statistical summary for both months are very similar. I would recommend creating an additional query of the precipitation data and compare both months. This information would be helpful because not only is ice cream best served on non rainy days, so would the conditions for surfing. When both conditions are not bad then W. Avy would be able to attract the most customers.  I would also creating a query showing the results of different stations' precipitation data. This would provide W. Avy the location with the least amount of rainfall to bring in most customers for both ice cream and surfing.
